There were a number of design decisions that I made early on, and then modifications to my design as I moved forward. First, I wanted 
to handle how having multiple levels and changing levels, since I thought that would be one of the more difficult aspects of the game.
I decided on creating classes for each class, since I created the map layout with a number of methods. Since both levels would share a lot
of similar methods, I decided to use a generic game map interface and then override the methods within each class. Using this design
actually made it very easy to manage switching levels, and handling keys/doors on different levels. I also used an observer pattern
to handle how the enemy bug moves on level two. This added a little more fun to level two, since the bug could follow Chip around the map,
rather than be confined to moving in a predetermined pattern. Although these both worked well, there were a number of things I wish I 
handled differently. For one, I could have done the keys/special walls a lot more elegantly; I wish I had classes for both the keys
and the special doors, and used a better data structure (map) to handle the counts of each key that Chip had. Also, the method for 
removing images from the map was very troubling and ultimately I had to leave them on the map because I couldn't figure out the
Javafx errors I was getting.
